# 4x4Multiplier
## Aim
  1. To create a 4x4 multiplier first in ngspice and verilog (alongwith testbenches) and use the learning to make a magicSpice implementation of the same
  2. To minimise the magicSpice design for area, power and propogation delay

## Required Software
  1. iVerilog 
  2. GTKWave (for verilog time domain plots)
  3. ngspice (compiled from source @ https://github.com/imr/ngspice/tree/master)
  4. magic (compiled from source @ https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic)
  5. miscellaneous dependencies (Cairo, etc)
